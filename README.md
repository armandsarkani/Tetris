****Tetris**** A simple block game for Android.

## Functionalities

[//]: # (Write [x] to mark off what was accomplished.<br/>)

* [x] Puzzle pieces fall from the top of the screen.
* [x] The player can move the puzzle piece one square to the left or right.
* [x]  The player can rotate the piece by 90 degrees.
	* Rotates as long as the newly rotated piece doesn't intercept other blocks.
* [x] The player can accelerate the fall by pressing the down arrow.
	- Pushing the down button accelerates the piece downward and doesn't make it fall instantly.
* [x]  The piece stops when it hits another piece.
* [x]  If an entire horizontal line is full of blocks, it disappears.
* [x]  Keeps a running score.
* [x]  Shows the next piece to fall.
* [x]  Runs on emulator Android 9.0 (Pie) - API Level 28.
* [x] "New Game" button 
* [x] Alert when the game is over, with buttons for the user to restart the game or exit the app
* [x] Dynamic compatibility with many different screen sizes/resolutions due to variable size of Tetris grid based on device resolution. Tested and works best with Pixel 3 XL and Pixel 2 XL.
* [x] Support for multi-touch swiping gestures (instead of buttons) to move pieces left, right, down (accelerate), or rotate pieces (up). Rejects swipes that would place the piece outside of the safe zone for the grid.
* [x] Special "score booster" Easter egg :)
* [x] "High score" feature that saves highest score locally into the phone's storage
* [x] Plays official Tetris theme song\* (with mute button that saves preferences)
* [x] Dark mode that turns entire user interface black (saves preferences for future launches)!
* [x] Ability for user to change the current tetromino (to another random one) while it is still falling
